<p id="description">The goal is to improve the response time of GPS data to the user interface. Data flows from MongoDB to the server which then transmits it to the GUI via WebSocket connections. To maintain data integrity and ensure smooth operation separate connections were established for each network and bus. This approach prevents data mixing and facilitates a seamless data flow for real-time mapping on the Leaflet map.</p>
